						<p>Kinect (codenamed in development as Project Natal) is a line of motion sensing input devices 
						by Microsoft for Xbox 360 and Xbox One video game consoles and Windows PCs. Based around a 
						webcam-style add-on peripheral, it enables users to control and interact with their console/computer 
						without the need for a game controller, through a natural user interface using gestures and spoken 
						commands.[9] The first-generation Kinect was first introduced in November 2010 in an attempt to 
						broaden Xbox 360's audience beyond its typical gamer base.[10] A version for Windows was released 
						on February 1, 2012.[6] Kinect competes with several motion controllers on other home consoles, 
						such as Wii Remote Plus for Wii and Wii U, PlayStation Move/PlayStation Eye for PlayStation 3, 
						and PlayStation Camera for PlayStation 4.</p>
